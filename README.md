### *What is the Aca-Desk?*
---
The Aca-Desk is a system that upgrades the traditional desk and focuses on increasing overall efficiency in the classroom. The system incorporates an advanced classroom attendance technique, a simple yet informative interface, and a myriad of other features. 

In theory, a student will go to their desk, scan their ID to an RFID scanner mounted to their desk. This will send a request to the server, which will simultaneously log the check-in to an SQL database table and retrieve the relevant information for the student who has just logged in. The server will send this information the web application, which is then displayed on the screen which is also mounted on the student's desk. The web app will have various screens displaying information that the student may find useful, such as their class schedule, upcoming homework and tests, and the bathroom queue if they are on line (how many students are ahead).

Both the hardware and software are instrumental in the project's success, but the software benefits the most from this sort of documentation.
